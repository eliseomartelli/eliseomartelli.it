    "raw": "\nWhat's an iPad? Is it a real computer? You might ask. Well, long story short: you can look at it as a computer only if your **use-cases** match what Apple envisioned for it. Letâ€™s take a deep dive into it.\n\n![A confused iPad](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliseomartelli/illustrations/main/svg/confusedipad.svg)\n\niPadOS is a **fun computing platform** designed for a _touch-first_ interaction model, and let me get this straight: it excels at it.  \nIf you take a look at **competing platforms** like Windows, ChromeOS, or Android, you will see ecosystems that are **far from perfect** on tablets.  \nThese platforms are designed with input paradigms tied to a mouse and a keyboard or a smartphone interface.  \nThe iPad, on the other hand, is _distinctive_ and what sets it apart is the **App ecosystem**.  \nHowever, this shouldn't be an invitation to Apple to stop fixing things or adding new features to the iPad.\n\n## There's an app for that\n\nThe iPad platform offers a **clean slate** that developers are happy to use and develop for. The App Store is full of pretty **good iPad apps**.  \nThe quality of these apps is usually _top-notch_ and the often powerful chips on these devices help to deliver a smooth experience.\n\nLooking through an Android user's perspective, one of the most **fascinating** things is that the developer **adoption** of new frameworks or new hardware features is always **fast**. Developers are keen on updating their apps to take advantage of these new features.\nThere's always something _fresh_ on the iPad and each iPadOS update brings new features to the table.\n\n### Productivity & Creativity\n\nOne of the main reasons I bought an iPad is to run productivity apps.\nApple took a **great stance** with the introduction of the **Apple Pencil** and the Smart Keyboard(s). The iPad has become a productivity-first device and not another content consumption machine.\n\nApps like [**GoodNotes**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodnotes-5/id1444383602), [**Pretext**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000), or [**Concepts**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/concepts/id560586497) feel right at home on the iPad. Starting from iPadOS 13.4, the addition of first-class mouse support on the iPad brought exciting new possibilities to this platform.\n\n**Creativity-oriented** apps on the iPad are **powerful** yet simple. You will comfortably adapt from a keyboard and mouse workflow to the iPad since creating something on it requires less cognitive load.  \nI'm a big fan of apps like [**Procreate**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/procreate/id425073498) (even though I can't draw). Keep in mind that developers are bringing more and more desktop apps to the iPad. On the App Store, you'll see names like Affinity Designer, Affinity Photo. There's even a slice of Adobe Creative Cloud apps on the iPad!\n\n## Input on the iPad\n\nI feel like this is an area of the iPad experience that can take a **little revision**. Input feels fluid, some of the interactions are well presented and understandable but there are times I find them very **confusing**.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4Pv3rEjI4fQ\" frameBorder={0} allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\nJust look at this video by Apple Support. It's just scratching the surface. Now add a trackpad, a keyboard, and the Apple Pencil. It's _gesture-ville_!  \nThere's even a _shake-to-undo_ gesture on by default and the best time to discover it is when you're trying to get something done inside a vehicle.\n\n![Undo typing popup](https://i.ibb.co/D4NKn5g/aintthatfun.png)\n_Oh, Hi! Hello there!_\n\n### Apple Pencil, a must that comes at a price\n\nThe Apple Pencil is one of the accessories that **separate** the iPad experience **from other tablets**. It's not an extension of your fingers. It's a **tool** designed for **content creation**.  \nWith iPadOS 14 and the introduction of **Scribble** and **handwriting editing**, you can use the Apple Pencil on a lot more apps.\n\n![The Apple Pencil](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliseomartelli/illustrations/main/svg/applepencil.svg)\n\n> If you're using the iPad for anything more other than content consumption, the Pencil is a **must**.\n\nThe responsiveness of the Pencil is **remarkable**. It feels like you're writing on paper. There are only one problem and two annoyances:\n\n1. It **costs** 1/3 of the cheapest iPad;\n2. **Placement** and **charging** of the first generation is ridiculous (solved by the second generation);\n3. **Not every part** of the iPad interface **supports it** (more on this later).\n\n### Mouse and Keyboard\n\nThe default software keyboard is okay. It's the only keyboard I know that supports **split typing** on the iPad. It's **responsive** most of the time. The only problem I encountered with it is when using a combination of keyboard-based input and the new \"Scribble\" feature.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mqefxehXa_c\" frameBorder={0} allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\nWhen you add a physical keyboard and a mouse to the iPad equation, it starts **feeling like a real computer**. Text interaction is instantly **natural**. If you're coming from a macOS machine, the majority of the **shortcuts are the same**.\n\nThe mouse/trackpad experience on the iPad is **far from the desktop-like experience** and not in a bad way. The cursor is **optimized for touch-first interfaces** and morphs into the UI element you're trying to point and click and sticks to it, like a magnet.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZP0zeUfYt7U\" frameBorder={0} allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\n## Multitasking\n\niPadOS is a _focus-centric_ operating system. It has **interesting** multitasking abilities although, for me, they are meant to be used in a burst when a single app on screen can be limiting.\n\nI find myself using the \"Slideover\" feature a lot when I need to check on something quickly and not strictly related to the main task. Instead, I use the split-screen feature to reference notes and transfer data between apps.\n\nThe **discoverability** factor of the various multitasking features is pretty **low**. How am I supposed to know, at a glance, that there are multiple drop targets for the apps?\n\nA limitation that may seem small of the iPad multitasking is that it's only limited to apps you have in the **dock** or dragged from **Spotlight**. You will quickly realize that it's **not a small limitation** when you can't trigger Spotlight from other apps if you don't have a keyboard attached.\n\nSomething **funny** about the multitasking UI is that you **can't use** it with the **Apple Pencil**. Strange. I can drag files and apps just fine with the Pencil elsewhere in the system.\n\n## Settings\n\nI feel like settings on iPadOS are **flawed**. The idea of **centralizing** everything under one roof looks good even though it's not something every developer adapted their apps for. You'll find a lot of **inconsistencies** and settings **scattered** between the app and the Settings app.\n\n![Procreate inside Settings App](https://i.ibb.co/2cstJ5C/IMG-0617.png)\n\n![Settings inside Procreate](https://i.ibb.co/DYgJt3N/IMG-0616.png)\n<i className=\"text-center\">Procreate settings example</i>\n\nWhat are the **criteria** used to move a setting from one screen to another? **I will never know.**\n\n## Home Screen\n\nThe iPad home screen remained **simple** even with the advent of iPadOS 14. I'd love to see widgets on the home screen like the iOS counterpart.\nThe icon grid is well-spaced. Selecting the \"more\" option is something you should do immediately.\n\nI wish Apple gave us the ability to use the **App Library** on the iPad since the home screen can get messy when you have a lot of apps.\n\n## File Management\n\nFile management on the iPad happens inside the \"Files\" app. You can also see connected **external drives** in the Files app.  \nThe iPad doesn't expose its whole **filesystem** to apps. Inter-app communication can happen in two ways: [**FileProvider**](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileprovider) or the **share sheet.**\n\n![Pretext and iSH](https://i.ibb.co/NS2G5xS/IMG-0608.jpg)\n<i className=\"text-center\">Pretext and iSH working togheter via the FileProvider Framework.</i>\n\nApps using the FileProvider Framework can see other apps files and work with them. It's a little feature that can enable powerful workflows on the iPad.  \nFor example, you can connect your camera to your iPad and access pictures from Pixelmator Photo. Edit the images and then save them to Google Drive without switching any app.\n\n## Scriptable goodness\n\nAnother powerful app on the iPad is \"Shortcuts\".\n**Shortcuts** are like mini-applets that you can make to **automate** all sorts of things. You can use them to send commands to other machines via SSH or to consume a REST API.\n\nIf you're an automation geek you'll feel right at home with its interface.  \nI use Shortcuts to compress images, control my Torrent box, and shorten URLs.\n\n![An illustration of me with an iPad and a heart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eliseomartelli/illustrations/main/svg/doilovemyipad.svg)\n\n## Honorable Mentions\n\n- **HomeKit** is the fastest way to control my smart home since it controls devices locally and it's not cloud-dependent.\n\n- **Spotlight** search is _really_ fast and apps integrate with it nicely.\n\n- The **App Store** \"Today\" view is well-curated and often brings up some hidden gems. App discoverability, in general, is stellar on the iPad.\n\n## Wish List\n\nI wish Apple took the developer market more seriously with the iPad. A built-in **UNIX shell** would make me very happy.  \nAnother wish would be better **conferencing** app support on the iPad since only FaceTime can use the popup view.\n\nOverall, the iPad is proving a **powerful** device to learn, create, and consume on. It's making me **curious** about iOS in general.\nThe iPad is a device that I'm more than happy using. I don't see it parting away from my digital life anytime soon.\n",

A cache server is a great tool to **speed up** recurring network requests (example: system updates) and reduce the overall used internet bandwidth.

Today we'll see how to set-up a cache server for our Apple devices.

Let's say that you have multiple Apple devices on your network and you happen to have a macOS device **always powered on** (or a macOS vm, ed.), you can use the after-mentioned device as a cache for your other devices.

To **check** if it's possible to use your Mac as a caching server, run this command:

```bash
$ AssetCacheManagerUtil canActivate
```

If you get a "**yes**" as a response, you can set-up your cache server via this simple command:

```bash
$ sudo AssetCacheManagerUtil activate
```

Your devices will now discover this cache server automatically after a **reboot**.

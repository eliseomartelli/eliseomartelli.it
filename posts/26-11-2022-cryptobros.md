Whenever I read around the web terms like crypto, web3 or nft, the blanket of pure skepticism covers my eyes, and I can't stop myself from asking questions about the subject.

The shift of ownership to the users, arguably the only point of interest of Web3, is just an afterthought and a promise, so people buy the latest shitcoin.
The term itself is a money-mover, a way for VC to gather cash fast from enthusiasts.

The vision presented by the crypto-enthusiast is at the edge of dystopia, and sometimes it becomes _religious_.

My criticism of Web3 is mainly on the crypto/nft side. Decentralization, on the other end, is a great concept and something that already exists in various forms.

BitTorrent, for instance, is an example of decentralization. It has been around for at least 20 years without any signs of cryptocurrency.
Other examples are ActivityPub, IPFS, ...

"Cryptobros" usually call me a hater, but I can't see the class of problems this technology is supposed to solve.
Web3 became the umbrella term for the gamification/reification of everything around us.

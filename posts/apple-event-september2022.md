As of every year, we just had Apple's September event: "Far out".  
Since I'm an Apple user interested in the evolution of Apple products, I decided to gather my thoughts on what they presented today.

As usual, the conference was tightly packed with _sci-fi-esque_ transitions, an implacable succession of speakers, and lots of marketing mumbo-jumbo that is necessary to swallow the price of the new products and inspire uses to justify the expense. And it works. I'm pretty sure that the retention rate of Apple's conferences is one of the highest in the industry looking at the view numbers on YouTube.

Let's begin with the new (but also old) kid on the block.

## The iPhone 14 series

This year's iPhone is an incremental update to the proven iPhone we all know, bringing small things in, year after year, and smoothing out the edges _(pun intended)._  
As the silicon for new products gets more streamlined each year, the A16 offers a [TSMC 5nm second-generation](https://www.tsmc.com/english/dedicatedFoundry/technology/logic/l_5nm) production process that helps with power consumption and in keeping things "fresh" in the constrained thermal envelope of the iPhone.

## Apple Watch Series 8

## AirPods Pro 2

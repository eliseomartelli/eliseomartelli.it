title: Some introductions for the first issue
---

Hello, world!

Here is the first issue of this newsletter. You can find me writing
about topics that interest me here.
I will occasionally send a picture or two, maybe some songs I'm
listening to.

Talking of listening, I really enjoyed [Tom Odell - Another Love (Live)](https://songwhip.com/tom-odell/another-love),
but this week, [Actual Life from Fred Again..](https://songwhip.com/fred-again/actual-life-april-14-december-17-2020) was on repeat.

I also [bought some Polaroids](https://eliseomartelli.it/blog/2023-11-27-polaroid) because I got a good deal,
I think that I'm slowly getting addicted to instant photography... Oops...

Last week I started watching the third season of "The Morning Show". On the spot, I can only say the references to Elon Musk are on the heavy side. No spoilers, tho!

I also enjoyed some reads:

- [The UNIX HATERS Handbook](https://web.mit.edu/~simsong/www/ugh.pdf) made me giggle a bit;
- I finished reading Mel√ºck, Maria Blainville by Achim von Arnim. I didn't find it really pleasing, maybe a bit bland. Let's say I'd not suggest it to a friend;
- I started reading Heauton Timorumenos because my friend Elisa lent it to me.

Oh, I reworked the photo gallery on my personal website and implemented this
newsletter from _scratch_. I think I'll blog about both soon.

I'll close off with a _toot_ (lol mastodon) about the [state of modern desktop](https://mastodon.social/@eliseomartelli/111443352646077604). Yeah, I hate it.

Feel free to respond to this email!  
Eliseo

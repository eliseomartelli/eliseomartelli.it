title: Same content, brand new site
---

Hello,

I should probably update this newsletter more often, but I have some exciting
news to share about the site.

I recently [rewrote](https://github.com/eliseomartelli/eliseomartelli.it) the
entire site to be more modern and readable. Along the way, I also fixed some
layout quirks. On top of that, I built a new [recommendation
engine](https://www.eliseomartelli.it/blog/2025-03-11-recomendation-system)
using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to surface relevant posts.

Earlier this month, I wrote about the [declining
quality](https://www.eliseomartelli.it/blog/2025-03-02-apple-quality) of
Appleâ€™s software. The post gained traction on
[Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/duplicates/1j30zzv/apples_software_quality_crisis_when_premium/),
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43243075), and
[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/s/epok9v/apple_s_software_quality_crisis_when).

I also wanted to share a snippet from a night walk with
[nomnp](https://nomnp.com):

> I often find myself feeling disconnected from reality when I'm adjacent to
> superficial conversations. It's not just boredom or a lack of interest, but a
> true mental detachment, as if my brain refuses to process information it
> perceives as empty.

This is something I might explore in a future blog post.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

Best,  
Eliseo

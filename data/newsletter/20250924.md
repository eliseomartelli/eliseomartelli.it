title: I don't hate Apple, but...
---

Hello,

We're some weeks into the new Apple platform releases, and by far I think
we have the worst software quality we've seen in years. I don't hate Apple,
but for me it's becoming increasingly difficult to justify being a loyal
customer.

The new platforms are riddled with bugs and inconsistencies, and the overall
user experience feels rushed and unfinished. It's disappointing to see a
company that once set the standard for quality and innovation fall short in
these areas.

I'm not alone in this sentiment, my great friend [Francesco](https://nomnp.com)
is having similar expereinces.

I'm sharing some of my thoughts on my
[blog](https://www.eliseomartelli.it/blog).

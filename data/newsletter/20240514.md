title: Some updates
---

Hello!

I'm thrilled to share some exciting updates with you since my last newsletter.  
Let me dive right in!

What's new:

- I had the opportunity to speak at a
  [conference](https://www.eliseomartelli.it/blog/2024-04-12-borsisti-day), it
  was a great experience and I have more talks lined up in the future;
- On the coding front, I've started working on some open-source bioinformatics
  projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/CREDOProject);
- And yeah, I
  [lost time with Winget](https://www.eliseomartelli.it/blog/2024-02-29-windows).

I'm committed to writing more articles for the blog and sharing my experiences
with you. If you have any topics in mind, please let me know. I'd love to hear
your ideas.

Additionally, I've lately been thinking about giving the website a modern
makeover (finding time will be the difficult part, ahah).

Feel free to reply to this email!  
Eliseo

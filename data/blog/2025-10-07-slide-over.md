A few weeks ago, I expressed my concern about the loss of iPadOS 26's essence
as it transformed into a fully windowing environment.  
  
Today, Apple has partially addressed my call: Slide Over is back, baby!

With the release of iPadOS 26.1 Beta 2, Apple has restored Slide Over. This new
version of Slide Over resides within an updated "container" paradigm, which
differs from the previous version of a floating "app". However, it introduces a
new feature: resizable windows.  

Users can resize, move, and manipulate the Slide Over window, maintaining its
temporary nature rather than functioning as a full app window. This compromise
strikes a balance between power and immediacy.  

I genuinely appreciate Apple's decision to bring Slide Over back. It restores
an essential aspect of the iPad's identity and it demonstrates Apple's
commitment to the simplicity that made iPadOS unique in the first place.  

One additional (re issued) feature I would like to see is the return of task
switching within Slide Over. The previous stack of apps tucked on the side
facilitated seamless multitasking. Reintroducing this feature would complete
the experience.  

For now, it's simply gratifying to witness the iPad regaining a sense of its
rhythm.

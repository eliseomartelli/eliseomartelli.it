Over the past week, I've been making an effort to strike a balance between my
digital and analog life. Between finally having the
[time](/blog/2026-02-13-automating-my-cv-with-latex-and-github-actions) to do
some [personal
projects](/blog/2026-02-17-less-but-better-a-braun-clock-for-the-r36s), and my
usual photography walks, I started to rely on the gym as my
analog escape, thanks to my [friends](https://nomnp.com). I just want to put on
my headphones, listen to some Burial or JPEGMafia to tune out the background
noise, and lift.

The current state of digital fitness tools makes that surprisingly
difficult. Rather than acting as a simple tools that do one thing well, the
modern fitness app has become a bloated, privacy-invading ecosystem.

I tried out a few popular fitness apps, and the experience was underwhelming.

One of the biggest mistake gym apps make is demanding too much cognitive load
before you even log a workout. During onboarding, they want you to set up an
entire multi-day split, enter exact body stats, and sit through tutorials.
When using the app at the gym, resting for 60 seconds between sets, I need
a frictionless interface. Everything else just interrupts the physical flow.

Human physiology isn't a simple math equation. When an app rigidly demands
that you maintain a streak or push through six consecutive training days
without rest, it ignores the realities of life and fatigue.

Fitness apps collect incredibly intimate data, from geolocation to biometric
vitals, yet many operate with broadly-worded privacy policies that allow them
to share this information with third-party data brokers and advertisers.

At the end of the day, a fitness app should be a good appliance:
it should capture the data perfectly, feel great to use, and then get
completely out of your way.

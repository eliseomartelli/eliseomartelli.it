Since I started browsing [minifeed.net](https://minifeed.net) more frequently,
I've found myself reading more and more articles and subscribing to more RSS
feeds, this also makes me feel more connected to the indie web.

Today, I came across this excerpt from
[thejaymo.net](https://thejaymo.net/2025/04/10/marking-the-occasion-100425/)'s
blog that truly resonates with me:

> A blog in 2025 should be a destination. They don't just distribute — they
> accumulate. They hold time, build presence, and concretise.

This resonates with me at an opportune moment, as I've been writing more
frequently and gradually overcoming my fear of expressing my thoughts in
public.


Cesare Nai — a friend of mine currently working on
[Miraggio](https://miraggiomag.substack.com), a blog/newsletter
built around interviews with photographers — and I had a conversation last
Saturday. Despite the 100 kilometers between us, we simultaneously realized
that our pursuit of perfection in every area of life has been chipping away at
the joy of simply doing things.

While talking with my friend Elisa, I admitted that I struggle with dating
apps. Not because I'm unwilling to try — but mostly because I'm "me". I have my
quirks, and I'm not convinced six pictures and three prompts are enough to
convey them. That's probably why those platforms don't really work for me.

While talking to my friend Elisa, I observed that I find it difficult to use
dating sites, not because I’m not willing to try, but mostly because I’m "me".
I have my quirks, and 6 pictures and 3 prompts surely don't help "selling" what
I truly am.  
Hence why, I think that the mechanics of those platforms are not for me.

I don't know if I will close this experiment soon, since I'm currently in the
mood to meet more people.

I finished reading Tamara Shopsin's "LaserWriter II", and I'm collecting some
highlights from the book to write about it (it helps me to be mindful when
reading).

I bought a new photo book in a street market titled "IL FOTOGIORNALISMO IN
ITALIA - LINEE DI TENDENZA E PERCORSI."

During the weekend, I visited Sala Gonin, a Baroque architectural room located
on the ground floor of the Torino Porta Nuova station. Once used as a waiting
room for the sovereigns and the Savoy court. The frescoes in the room symbolize
the three essential elements required for the functioning of a steam engine:
fire, water, and coal.

To close off the week, yesterday I went to take a beer with
[Francesco](https://nomnp.com), and we watched the compilation of a C++
codebase. I also tried "Punt e Mes" for the first time, and I swear I taste
sour cherries in it.

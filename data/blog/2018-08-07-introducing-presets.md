I love computer science and programming but my heart is a pretty big place and it can handle a lot of things.  
Photograpy is one of those.

This is my first public preset pack and it's an expandable system.  
It's the first Lightroom/Adobe Camera Raw preset pack published on Github that I'm aware of so anyone can submit new things to the pack.

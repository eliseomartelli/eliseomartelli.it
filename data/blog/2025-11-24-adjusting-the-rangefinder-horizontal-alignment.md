First things first, let me take this out of the way: I am not a professional
camera technician. However, I have had to adjust the rangefinder horizontal
alignment on several Leica cameras, and I have found a method that works well
for me. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.
Poking tools inside your camera carries significant risk. If you are
uncomfortable with precision adjustments, please send your camera to a
qualified technician.

## The Diagnosis

Before even thinking about adjusting the rangefinder, you need to confirm that
it is indeed misaligned. The most straightforward way I have found to do this
is to:

1. Pick a target with high contrast details, such as a newspaper or a brick
   wall at a focus distance you feel comfortable working with (e.g., 1-3
meters).
2. Focus the lens and check the patch. The image should be sharp and the two
   images should align perfectly.
3. Take a test shot and review it. If the image is not sharp, it may indicate a
   misalignment.

## Am I back/front focusing?

Before adjusting the rangefinder, it's crucial to determine whether your camera
is back-focusing or front-focusing.

This can be done by taking a series of test shots, wiggle the focus ring
slightly back and forth around the point where you believe the focus is
sharpest. If the sharpest focus occurs when the focus ring is slightly turned
towards infinity, your camera is back-focusing. Conversely, if the sharpest
focus occurs when the focus ring is turned slightly towards the minimum focus
distance, your camera is front-focusing.

## The Adjustment

What you will need:

- 2mm Hex Key (Allen Wrench): High quality is essential. A cheap one may strip
the screw.
- A high contrast target for focusing.
- Patience and a steady hand.
- A lens that you are comfortable working with.
- Good lighting conditions.

Steps:

- Start by putting yourself at 2 meters from the target, straight on, and
focus the lens carefully on that target, using the rangefinder patch.
- Take a test shot and review it.
- Remove the lens from the camera body.
- Locate the rangefinder adjustment screw. The screw on the roller is for
horizontal alignment.
- Using the 2mm hex key, make small adjustments to the screw.
- After each adjustment, reattach the lens, focus on the target again, and take
a test shot.
- Review the test shot to see if the focus has improved.
- Repeat the adjustment process until the focus is sharp.

**Always apply gentle, steady torque.**

**Note**: Rangefinders are designed to be calibrated at infinity focus.
However, many users find it more practical to calibrate at a closer distance,
such as 2 meters. This is because most of their photography occurs at closer
distances, and calibrating at 2 meters can provide better accuracy for their
typical shooting scenarios.

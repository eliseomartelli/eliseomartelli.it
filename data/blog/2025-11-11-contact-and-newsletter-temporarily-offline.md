The spam volume received through the contact function and the newsletter
function has recently crossed the threshold of "annoying" into "actively
degrading my life."
The signal-to-noise ratio in my inbox is now approaching zero, and sifting
through junk to find legitimate messages is no longer a sustainable task.

Effective immediately, I am temporarily disabling all site-based contact forms
and the newsletter subscription function.

This is a stop-gap measure. I am currently working on implementing a
low-friction defense for my readers: stateless proof of work.

Those who know me personally know how to reach me via standard channels.

Once the new system is solid, the functionality will return.

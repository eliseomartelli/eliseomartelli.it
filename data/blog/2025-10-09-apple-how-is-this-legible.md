Today I was using Apple Podcasts on my iPhone, and I noticed something that
made me do a double take. The text in the player, in the section where you ca 
change the playback speed, was rendered in a light gray color on a slightly
less light gray background. It was so faint that it was nearly impossible to
read.

You can't even say if the "Enchance Dialogue" option was selected or not.

A few weeks ago, I was reading The Beekeeper by Maxence Fermine.
It's a book about a boy who has always dreamed big,
and as I scrolled my eyes through those lines, it seemed like I already knew
that boy.

The essential part of the story is that this fella, against the thoughts of the
people in his small village, started his beekeeping business.
His first season ended abruptly with a fire,
so he decided to travel to seek gold, which, in his case, was honey.

One thing that united his expeditions was that, every time,
Aurelien found himself in a convoy of travelers, and even if these expeditions didn't succeed, he still had a wealth of experiences to bring home.

These convoys are a bit like all the people I met in my life.
Each person has made a substantial contribution to how I see things.

The first expeditions laid the foundations for
growth and shaped me into what I am today
(a bit of a dreamer and a bit foolish).

When I arrived in Turin,
a bit disoriented,
I tried to anchor myself to new people,
who with so much patience supported and endured me, for which I thank you.

Aurelien's story concludes with him actually finding gold.
It was right in front of his eyes.

I would like to express my appreciation to my family for their support and
encouragement throughout this journey. Their love, understanding, and belief in
me have been a constant source of inspiration. I would also like to extend my
thanks to my friends. Their encouragement has been invaluable, and I am
grateful for their friendship. To all, thank you.

I graduated.

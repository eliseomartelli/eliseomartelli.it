At the start of the week, I added a new phrase to my vocabulary: "Sgnacca il
butun," a quirky Piemontese expression meaning "push the button." â€¨

I had a meeting Maria from work after four long months. It's fascinating how
time apart makes reunions feel both familiar and fresh. I can't wait to
"chiamare una giornata" (literally, calling it a day) with her.

Later that day, I packed up for a trip back to Abruzzo, to embrace the Easter
festivities. The journey was a blast, literally. My brother and I played music
non-stop for seven hours.

Just after I got home and checked my blog, I began contemplating the need to
implement pagination. With nearly 50 articles under my belt, it felt like the
right time to enhance navigation.

On the tech troubleshooting front, on Monday, a Studio Display at work decided
to throw a tantrum, refusing to show any image. After scouring threads [like
this one](https://x.com/_inside/status/1506048543244627978), I found a simple
solution (I was already excited about having to do a DFU restore of a Studio
Display). An age-old Computer Science 101 trick worked fine: disconnect all the
cables and reboot.

Similarly, my parents' MacMini7,1 gave me a hard time, crashing repeatedly
between boot and login. Despite attempts with recovery mode, [progress was
minimal](/blog/2025-04-17-oclp-failure). Ah, the joys of technology.

My car also got a little care at the body shop after a kid bumped its scooter
on my fender, while I was waiting for my car back, I posted the review of
[Tamara Shopsin's "LaserWriter II"](/blog/2025-04-16-laserwriter-ii).

I took a peaceful stroll in Ortona, heading towards the Castello Aragonese, and
I thoroughly enjoyed capturing the interplay of light and ancient stone.

On Holy Thursday, I attended the traditional procession of hooded penitents in
Lanciano to take some photos. The participants, walked solemnly through the
narrow streets of the historic center, accompanied by drums and prayers.

Oh, I also have some future projects: my mother made some sourdough starter
(that I will gladly take). When I'll be back in Turin, I'll have some new
baking experiments to do!

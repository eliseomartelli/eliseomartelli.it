I've finally finished reading Tamara Shopsin's LaserWriter II after a reading
block that lasted for about two months, and it made me do some reflections on
what is happening with consumer electronics. This book is a love letter to a
specific moment in tech history, shaped by Apple not just with products, but
with culture.  

> Apple didn't make the first consumer laser printer; they made the fourth,
> after IBM, Xerox, and HP. The LaserWriter used the same exact Canon engine as
> the HP LaserJet, but the LaserWriter was better.

Apple understood something deeper: how to present technology in a way that
people could actually fall in love with.

That idea feels especially relevant today. Tim Cook, in an interview last year,
stated that Apple is not the first company to race to AI, he said Apple will be
the one that implements it the best for consumers. This statement should still
be relevant today, but we have yet to see the true advantages of Apple
Intelligence.

It surprised me how many of the book's lines stuck with me. Here are a few
favorites: 

> If you are ever in doubt, do the right thing

> Courage is as contagious as fear.

> Choosing NOT to do something is as much choosing to DO something. Free will
> is not just what you do, it is also what you don't.

It was a good read. I enjoyed it, even though some parts, like the
personification of printers' internals, were a bit over the top.  
The book was also filled with names, but with not so much space to let them
"breathe", so not every personality shone through.

Still, LaserWriter II captures something special: a moment when machines
weren't just tools, but extensions of care, obsession, and idealism.  
Can Apple still do what it once did best?

Oh, and one of the last phrases in the acknowledgments?

> Thanks to Apple for making computers that I love to an illogical degree.

LaserWriter II is a coming-of-age tale set in the legendary 90s indie NYC Mac
repair shop TekServe―a voyage back in time to when the internet was new, when
New York City was gritty, and when Apple made off-beat computers for weirdos.
Our guide is Claire, a 19-year-old who barely speaks to her bohemian
co-workers, but knows when it’s time to snap on an antistatic bracelet.

Tamara Shopsin brings us a classically New York novel that couldn’t feel more
timely. Interweaving the history of digital technology with a tale both
touchingly human and delightfully technical, Shopsin brings an idiosyncratic
cast of characters to life with a light touch, a sharp eye, and an unmistakable
voice.

Filled with pixelated philosophy and lots of printers, LaserWriter II is, at
its heart, a parable about an apple.

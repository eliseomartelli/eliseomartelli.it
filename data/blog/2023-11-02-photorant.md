It's so sad to see photography
influencers giving misleading
advice on this platform. One recent example?

> I only shoot with my ISO 800 or
> higher

This statement doesn't tell the
full story. ISO, like shutter speed and
aperture, is context dependendant.

The lesson should be to assess the
situation and then make informed
decisions on what settings to pick.

Giving away "magical settings" will
influence a new generation of "bad"
photographers.

Assess, set, shoot.

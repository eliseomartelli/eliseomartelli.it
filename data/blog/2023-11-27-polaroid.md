I kept a close eye on Polaroids since news about ["The Impossible Project"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaroid_B.V.) started surfacing (I was 12 at the time).

I never pulled the trigger and bought a Polaroid camera because I was always scared by the film cartridge prices, but last Saturday, I changed that.

I was reaching the city center with my brother on foot after visiting some friends at _Museo Ferroviario Piemontese_, working at the workshop near Ponte Mosca in Turin.
We were already near Porta Palazzo and the historical flea market called [Balon](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balon), a staple of the Aurora district, and after getting lost in the color, smells, lights, and sounds of that market, we reached the booth of a vintage camera and watches seller.

When we arrived, the seller was already packing back the goods for the day, but, in the rightmost corner of the stand, on top of a velvety red cloth, there were two Polaroid cameras: a Polaroid Land 1000 Camera (with a green button), and a Polaroid 636 Autofocus.

I made an impromptu decision, asked the seller for a price, and then quickly bought the two cameras (for â‚¬15 each).

It was now time to learn some more about the cameras, and after an _extreme_ Wikipedia and Reddit [(r/Polaroid)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polaroid/) search, I found out that the cameras accepted SX-70 film and 600 films, respectively.

The side-quest for the film was hilarious in its way. I first went to a local electronics retailer, Unieuro, where a Polaroid salesman told me I could get I-type film for my camera. Fortunately, I-type film has a big sticker with "Not for vintage cameras" written on it, so I backed out and went to another store: La Rinascente.

La Rinascente was running a sale for Polaroid film, and it was all out-of-stock, so I got out and walked into another shop. Il Grande Marvin. We found some expired SX-70 film, but nothing for my 636. It made me a bit sad. It later occurred to me to check on Amazon, where, surprisingly, I found some 600 films that I immediately ordered.

At home, we put the SX-70 pack inside the Land 1000. We were in awe at the whirring noises coming out of it. I imagine it was a "second birth" for that camera since it probably wasn't used in the last 20 to 30 years.
The next day, the film pack for my camera reached our door. I placed it inside the camera and closed the film flap. It whirred. It was as magical as the other one. When I saw the dark slide coming out and getting covered by the _tongue_, I was ecstatic. I told my brother to take a picture of me, and the camera flashed. After some milliseconds, the slide got ejected.

_Hey! A picture of me!_

I went for a walk with my brother later, when he took a chance and took a shot with his camera.
We heard whirring noises. We had another winner.

I fell into the Polaroid rabbit hole now. I'm planning to mod my camera to use new I-type film. I'll write another post if I succeed in that!

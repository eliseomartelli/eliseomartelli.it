## Abstract

This document specifies the Human Connection Protocol (HCP).
HCP standardizes the request, response, and keep-alive mechanisms involved in
interpersonal communication.
This protocol aims to enhance the predictability and reliability of human
interactions by formalizing communication exchanges.

## Introduction

Human connections are fundamental to social interaction. However, these
connections often suffer from misunderstandings, unpredictability, and
inefficiency due to the lack of standardized communication mechanisms. The
Human Connections Protocol (HCP) provides a structured approach to managing
these interactions, defining clear rules for initiating, responding to, and
maintaining human connections.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

- Requester: The entity that initiates the connection.
- Responder: The entity that responds to the connection request.
- Connection: A bidirectional channel of communication established between a
  Requester and a Responder.
- KeepAlive: A mechanism for maintaining the established connection.

## Protocol Overview

- Request: Initiation of a human connection.
- Response: Acknowledgment and acceptance, rejection, or forwarding (Relay) of
  the connection request.
- KeepAlive: Maintenance of the connection over time.
- Termination: Terminates an established communication channel.

## Message Format

All HCP messages MUST consist of the following fields:

- Type: Specifies the message type (Request, Response, KeepAlive).
- Timestamp: The time the message was created.
- Body: The content of the message.

## Request Operation

### Request Format

A Request message is used to initiate a connection. It SHOULD contain a brief introduction and an OPTIONAL topic of discussion.

```
Type: Request
Timestamp: <UTC Time>
Body: <Introduction and Topic>
```

### Request Handling

Upon receiving a Request, the Responder MUST process it and generate a Response message. The Requester MUST wait for this Response before any further action.

### Response Operation

Response Types

There are four possible types of Response messages:

- Accept: The Responder agrees to establish the connection.
- Reject: The Responder declines the connection request.
- Delay: The Responder acknowledges the request but cannot respond immediately.
- Relay: The Responder forwards the connection request to a third party, who MAY be better suited to respond.

### Response Format

```
Type: Response (Accept/Reject/Delay/Relay)
Timestamp: <UTC Time>
Body: <Acceptance Message, Rejection Message, Delay Explanation, or Relay Details>
```

- Accept: Upon receiving an Accept Response, the Requester and Responder SHOULD begin communication over the established connection.
- Reject: If a Reject Response is received, the Requester SHOULD NOT attempt to re-initiate the connection for a predefined cool-off period.
- Delay: A Delay Response indicates the Responder WILL follow up when they are ready.
- Relay: If a Relay Response is received, the Requester SHOULD wait for a response from the third party. The Relay Response MUST include contact details or an introduction to the third party.

## KeepAlive Operation

### KeepAlive Format

KeepAlive messages are used to maintain an active connection. These messages SHOULD be sent periodically and MUST be acknowledged by the Responder to ensure the connection remains valid.

```
Type: KeepAlive
Timestamp: <UTC Time>
Body: <Status Update or Simple Greeting>
```

### KeepAlive Handling

If a KeepAlive message is not acknowledged within a predefined timeout period, the connection SHOULD be considered lost, and both parties MAY reinitiate the connection if desired.

## Termination 

A connection CAN be terminated explicitly by either party at any time. Termination MAY be unilateral but MUST be communicated with a final message:

```
Type: Termination
Timestamp: <UTC Time>
Body: <Closure Explanation>
```

Upon receiving this message, the other party SHOULD acknowledge the termination, and the connection SHOULD be officially closed.

## Conclusion 

The Human Connections Protocol (HCP) standardizes human interaction, making it more predictable and reliable. By clearly defining the request, response, and keep-alive mechanisms, including the Relay option, HCP ensures smoother and more flexible interpersonal communication.

\[Un\]MuteMic is one of my favorite macOS utility apps. It's simple: a button
placed on the menu bar that lets you toggle the microphone status.
Since we are in the age of teleconferencing, it's a handy app, but
it got compiled a long time ago, about four years B.A.S. (Before Apple Silicon).

One of the first things I did after I got my new MacBook was to compile the app
for aarch64. It worked great!

Then I started adding a feature: global hotkey. I added this feature on the
existing codebase, initially written in Objective-C.

I've never really bonded with Objective-C. I find the syntax unnecessarily
verbose, so two days ago, I decided to rewrite the entire app in Swift and
SwiftUI.

At WWDC2022, Apple introduced
[MenuBarExtra](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/MenuBarExtra),
a Scene that renders a persistent item in the system menu bar.
It seemed appropriate to rewrite the app using this new Scene.

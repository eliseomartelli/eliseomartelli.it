As 2025 comes to a close, I'm taking a moment to commit this year to the
archives (pun intended).  
It's been a year defined by contrast. On one hand, I've seen growth in my
personal and professional life, but on the other hand, it required navigating
through plenty of friction.

I've had the opportunity to reconnect with old friends and enjoy company of 
my collegues. These genuine connections have been enriching my life in ways
I can't quantify.

I also faced challenges that tested my resilience, some originating from
people I trusted. While difficult, these experiences have taught me valuable
lessons about the value of boundaries and the importance of surrounding myself
with people who uplift me.  
It reinforced my own core principles:

- Create meaningful contributions that benefit others.
- Pursue what feels truly meaningful to me.
- Ensure my actions align with my values and ethics.

This year marked a tremendous change to my hobbies. I reignited my passion
for photography, capturing moments with friends, and the beauty of the mundane.  
A passion that I've been able to share with others, leading to new friendships
and influencing other friends to pick up the camera themselves.

Thank you to everyone who has been part of the loop this year. Your support
means everything.

See you in the new year.

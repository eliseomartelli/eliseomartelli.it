My recent decision to switch to TIM, one of Italy’s
[largest](https://www.mondomobileweb.it/293381-telefonia-mobile-quote-di-mercato-a-settembre-2024-fastweb-supera-il-5-di-sim-human/)
telecom providers, turned into a frustrating experience filled with technical
glitches, hidden fees, and customer service challenges. If you’re considering
TIM, you might want to think twice.

The TIM app has been problematic. It inexplicably logs me out constantly, even
mid-task, without any error message or explanation. This issue has also been
reported by [other
users](https://community.tim.it/argomenti/app/mytim/detail/130004).

While the mobile plan I subscribed to is competitively priced at €6.99/month
for 150GB of data, unlimited calls, and 200 SMS, I’ve encountered numerous
hidden fees that weren’t present with my previous provider, Iliad. The top
three annoyances are:

- SMS to Amazon Drivers: Charged €0.10 per message.
- iMessage Activation: Each activation costs €0.13, which adds up since I
  restore my devices every couple of months.
- Bank Messages: Priced at €0.16 per message.

These micro-charges feel like a bait-and-switch. While the amounts are small,
they’re not mentioned upfront and diminish trust in the provider’s
transparency.

The final straw was TIM’s handling of eSIMs. I opted for an eSIM to avoid
waiting for a physical card. The first eSIM email never arrived. Support was
unhelpful and advised me to “try again later.” I then purchased another eSIM
for €10 and was promised a refund for the first. The refund took over a month
to process, involving endless back-and-forth emails with a tone-deaf refund
department. This experience mirrors that of other users who have faced similar
challenges with TIM’s eSIM services.

Why should customers pay twice for a service that TIM failed to deliver? The
lack of accountability is staggering. Instead of troubleshooting, they shifted
the problem onto me.

My experience with TIM has been plagued with issues, from app malfunctions and
hidden fees to poor customer support. I can’t wait to switch back to Iliad.

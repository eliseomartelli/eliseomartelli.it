Growing up, I was mesmerized by Top Gear and later by The Grand Tour, hosted by
Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond. The show's final episode,
titled "One for the Road," left an indelible mark on me, especially with dire
straits' "Brothers in Arms" playing in the background. It felt like the end of
an era.

Today, during a conversation with my friend Roberto, I realized that I might
not purchase another car if electric vehicles (EVs) become the sole option
available. Over the past 15 years, EVs have gained significant traction on
Italian roads, transforming the automotive landscape in Italy.

One notable shift is the decline of traditional car ownership. Instead,
short-term leasing and subscription models have become more prevalent. This
trend accelerated with the entry of Chinese EV manufacturers into the European
market, offering affordable and technologically advanced vehicles.
Consequently, consumers are increasingly drawn to convenience and flexibility
rather than long-term commitment.

From my perspective in computer science, this shift reminds me of the "Cattle
vs. Pets" model. In IT, "pets" are unique servers that require individual
attention, while "cattle" are standardized and easily replaceable. Similarly,
cars have transitioned from cherished possessions to interchangeable tools.

As someone who has always been passionate about cars, this change is
disheartening. The emotional connection and sense of identity that once came
with car ownership are fading. While modern vehicles are efficient and
environmentally friendly, they often lack the character and individuality that
made driving a thrilling experience.

The sense of loss for those who view cars as more than just transportation is
growing, and as a car enthusiast, I find it increasingly challenging to fall in
love with a modern car.

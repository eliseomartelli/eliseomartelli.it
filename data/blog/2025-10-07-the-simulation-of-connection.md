When I've read this quote, I found it rhetorically fascinating. It blurs the
line between "connection" and "interaction".

Can we be clear about what's actually happening here? No one is actually
connecting with artists. Why are we continually trading away depth for
immediacy?

Some examples?

- We text instead of calling.
- We eat frozen food instead of cooking.
- We buy fast-fashion instead of clothes that last.
- We scroll through infinite feeds instead of engaging with a single work
deeply.

Each of these substitutions promises to *save time*, as if the goal of life
were to eliminate the experience of living itself. Friction is treated as an
obstacle to be optimized away. But friction is also what gives texture to
experience. The effort, the waiting, these are not bugs in the human condition.
They're _THE_ features.
O
When platforms like Spotify talk about "connecting fans with artists," they're
not selling music. They're selling *the feeling of intimacy*. The same way
social media sells the *feeling of community* or dating apps sell the *feeling
of romantic possibility*, or casinos the feeling of winning.

It's a form of emotional outsourcing. We no longer engage with music as an act
of discovery or empathy; we engage with it as a consumer interface designed to
deliver predictable microdoses of sentiment.

Art becomes data. Connection becomes simulation. Emotion becomes UX.

None of this is to condemn technology itself; it's to question the uncritical
way we let convenience dictate meaning.

At what point do we admit that we've lost the plot? Or are we clapping like
trained seals, caring only about superficial appearances?

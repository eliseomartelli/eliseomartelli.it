Today marks the day Telegram decided to roll out Stories (but only for Telegram
Premium users at the moment).

It adds to the (already long) list of apps having this "feature".

```bash
echo "Telegram" >> apps_with_stories
```

It's the right time to post a quote from a [friend of mine](https://nomnp.com):

The "stories" functionality in apps has become increasingly popular over the
years, and it originated on Snapchat in 2013.
They play on the unapologetically human fear of missing out, creating a sense
of urgency among viewers. This brings an increase of interaction time across
the platform. This is all part of the increasing need to share real-time
updates.

We don't need stories in messaging apps.

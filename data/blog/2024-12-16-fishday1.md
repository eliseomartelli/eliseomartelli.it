For the next week, I intend to experiment with utilizing Fish as my primary
shell on macOS. This challenge was initiated this morning by
[Francesco](http://nomnp.com), who encouraged me to explore Fish as an
alternative shell.

  Switching to Fish for a week?

## Installation

I followed these steps to install Fish: 

1. I used Homebrew to install fish.
```bash
$ brew install fish
```
 
2. I then added fish to the list of available shells.
```bash
$ which fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells > /dev/null
```

3. Then I switched my default shell.
```bash
chsh -s $(which fish)
```

## Something cool

A positive aspect of Fish is the use of the conf.d directory, which helps
organize configuration files into individual scripts, making it easier to
manage and update customizations without cluttering a single configuration
file.

One thing I’ve noticed is that Fish feels noticeably faster than my previous
setup with Zsh + Oh My Zsh. It seems more responsive, and the startup time
feels snappier.

## A first challenge
The default keybinding to edit a command using $EDITOR is Meta+E (contrary to
other shells ⌃+X ⌃+E). Since I use the ⌥ (Option) key as a **compose key** for
typing special characters, I cannot remap it to the Meta key.  I had to
configure a custom bind to bring back ⌃+X ⌃+E functionality.

```fish title="~/.config/fish/conf.d/bindings.fish"
# Edit command
bind \cx\ce edit_command_buffer
```

## Dotfiles
If you want to take a look at my configurations or follow along with the
changes I make throughout this experiment, you can check out my dotfiles
[here](https://github.com/eliseomartelli/dotfiles).

Throughout the week, I will continue experimenting with Fish and refining my
setup. Expect further updates!

Photography is not just a 3-tuple of light, time and space. Photography is a
whole art form involving creativity, composition, storytelling, and the
ability to convey meaning and evoke emotions. A photograph is an
interpretation of reality by the photographer.

A great photo needs at least two more ingredients:

- Emotions: they play a crucial role in human experience, they influence our
  perception.
- Information: data presented in a meaningful way, providing insight about a
  particular subject.

The interplay between emotions and information in photography enhances the
impact and resonance of the image.

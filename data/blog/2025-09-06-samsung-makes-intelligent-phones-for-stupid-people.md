I wonder what's up with the marketing team at Samsung. Lately I've seen some of
their ads popup on YouTube, I think they just released some phones, I don't
closely pay attention to them as a company since I think their phones are
unusable, as of my recent experience with a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, an A56
and an S24 Ultra.

I don't know what is the appeal for this kind of product, a product that
"probabilistically" gives you options from the real world, a product that
actively cuts you from human interaction, and a product that removes from you
spontaneous choices. 

Advertising a product that cuts you the reading, the thinking and ultimately
creativity is, in my opinion, harmful.

I think that Samsung should focus more on their core experiences, and less on
bulking up their phones with features no one asked for.

One example of their core interactions that went bad? Sharing a contact to
WhatsApp.

I open the Phone app, select the contact I want to share, and tap on
Share.

A prompt appears asking if I want to share as a VCF or as text, this should not
be on final software that goes in the hands of millions of users, I know what
VCF is because I’m a technical person, but imagine your grandma trying to
understand what VCF is. 

I choose VCF, and it takes me to another activity where I can select the fields
to include in the VCF. This activity isn't part of the Phone/Contacts app.

After selecting the fields, I proceed with sharing and choose WhatsApp. A toast
message pops up saying, "WhatsApp does not support this VCF file." Meanwhile,
the activity that initiated the sharing has closed, dropping me back into the
Contacts app.

I tap Share again, but this time it doesn't ask me how I want to share the
contact. So, I close the app and try again. This time, I select "Text" in the
sharing menu, but I can't find WhatsApp among the options, only apps like
Samsung Notes appear.

Frustrated, I hit the back button, open the contact again, but accidentally tap
it the wrong way™️, triggering a call. I end the call, tap the contact again,
copy the number, and finally paste it manually into WhatsApp.

How's that a good experience?

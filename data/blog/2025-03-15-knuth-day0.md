I started building a new app called Knuth, named after Donald Knuth, creator of
LaTeX. Why? Because after scouring the App Store, I realized there wasn’t an
app that perfectly fit my needs, so I’m making one myself.

Knuth will be an app designed for those who frequently work with LaTeX
formulas, whether you're a student, researcher, or math enthusiast.  
The goal is to make writing, saving, and interacting with LaTeX formulas as
seamless as possible, and feeling mostly like a first party iOS/iPadOS/macOS
app.

I’m planning these 7 core features for this App:

- Render LaTeX Formulas (Using iosMath to display formulas);
- Write Formulas with a Keyboard;
- Drag & Drop Formulas as images;
- Save Formulas Locally & in iCloud (Using SwiftData);
- Edit Previously Saved Formulas;
- Attach a Name to Formulas;
- Formula History (Think Time Machine, But for Math).

I would also like to have:

- PencilKit Integration
- Convert handwritten formulas to LaTeX with Im2LaTeX.
- Import Formulas from Photos
- Custom IME to select, insert, or edit formulas on the fly.

Stay tuned for updates as I bring Knuth to life. Any suggestion is welcome!

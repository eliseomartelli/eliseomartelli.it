Hey, it's been a while since I last wrote about Apple products, and the last
time I did, I was [pretty critical](/blog/2025-03-02-apple-quality) of the
state of the software. Today, the software doesn't seem to have improved much,
but as a nerd, I couldn't resist getting my hands on the new iPhones, and doing a
little trip to the Apple Store.

Today is the day of the launch of the new iPhones, and since I had a preorder
in for a family member, I offered myself to accompany them to the Apple Store
to get a change of experiening all the other products.

The Apple Store in Via Roma, Turin was packed with influencers and videomakers,
trying to get the shots of the new iPhones with their DJI Osmo
something-something.

I want to provide a short overview/review of all the models, since I had the
opportunity to try them all.

## iPhone 17

The iPhone 17 is the new entry-level model, and it comes in a variety of
colors, that loook like they were chosen because they were out of the paints
leftover from last year.

Othen than that, the iPhone 17 is a solid phone, basically last year's iPhone
but with better cameras, better screen (now with ProMotion) and the same 
pricetag as last year.

I think this is the only new iPhone that is worth considering.

## iPhone 17 Pro

The iPhone 17 Pro is the new high-end model, and it comes with a all-new
aluminum body. The new aluminum body is a bit of a mixed bag: on one hand, it
is better thermally than the titanium of the previous models, but on the other
hand, it feels a bit cheaper.

The cheapness is echoed by the Camera Plateau, which with the new material, is
subject to scratches and dents. The new color options are also a bit
questionable, I think I hate the orange one the most.

I’m not convinced about the durability of the aluminum, considering that my
iPhone 16’s sides corroded because of my sweat (and I use my phone for 2 hours
a day max).

The window glass on the back is also an element of concern. It's not an elegant
iPhone.

## iPhone 17 Air

The iPhone 17 Air is the new mid-range model, and it comes with a new design
that is incredible.
It's incredibly thin and light, and it feels like a piece of jewelry.

The polished titanium rails are a fingerprint magnet, but they look
incredible when clean.
The light blue one is my favorite.

The iPhone 17 Air is a beauty, but is full of compromises, like zero stereo 
imaging, a smaller battery, and a single camera.

## Apple Watch Series 11

It's basically the same as the Series 10, but now with the possibility of 5G.

## Apple Watch Ultra 3

It's basically the same as the Ultra 2, but now with the possibility of 5G.

## Apple Watch SE 3

It's basically a Series 9 but without the ECG and the blood oxygen sensor.
It's the one to get.

## AirPods Pro 3

They sound great, but the case materials and the case’s lid that has a lot of
play (compared to my AirPods Pro (1st generation)) don’t convince me.

In conclusion, I think this year Apple has made some questionable choices,
both in terms of design and materials, and in the way they are distributing 
features across the lineup.

This year I decided to not get any of the new iPhones, and I will stick
with my iPhone 16 Pro for another year.

I think I will do a review of the new platform releaeses in the next weeks,
since I used for a big part of the summer the various betas.

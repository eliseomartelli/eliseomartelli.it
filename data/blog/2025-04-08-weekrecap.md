Over the past week, I've been making an effort to strike a balance between my
digital and analog life.

My goals were to spend more time outdoors, overcome a reading slump, and focus
on a project that brings me value.

With the beautiful weather in Turin last week, I decided to take more frequent
breaks from screens and return to street photography.

It's been challenging to _care_ about the pictures I'm taking, but I'm trying
to be patient with myself. I know that with time, I’ll rediscover my
appreciation for the process.

I've started reading Tamara Shopsin's "LaserWriter II," which, as an Apple fan,
I'm really enjoying. It's a nostalgic tribute to the Apple culture of the late
90s and early 2000s, and I'm thoroughly absorbed in it. (I'm also considering
writing a review of this book.)

At work, I've been developing a domain-specific language using Lisp's
S-Expressions. This project is allowing me to explore language design, and it's
a breath of fresh air, since my last project was focused on a deployment of a
bioinformatics-centered analysis platform.

My recent days have been accompanied by the music of Four Tet and Burial. Their
minimalist and repetitive soundscapes help me enter focused states, as they
effectively silence all background noise in the office environment.

When I'm listening to music for leisure, I'm enjoying 80s and 90s pop and rock
songs. As I write this piece, I'm listening to Christina Aguilera’s "Genie in a
Bottle."

I've also been experimenting with a gluten-free bun recipe. After several
attempts, I've finally achieved a result I'm satisfied with. I'm currently
aiming for a 110% hydration level.

Last week, two close friends graduated from university, and we had a delightful
outdoor lunch in a nearby town. We laughed a lot and indulged in some tasty
food (more than I'd like to admit.)

In addition to these activities, I've been dealing with some car issues. The
back driver-side door's strip and the drain holes in the same door aren't
working as expected, and I'm still having trouble with the speaker every time
it rains.

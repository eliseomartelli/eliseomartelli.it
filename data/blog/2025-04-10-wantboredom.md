One of the things I detest the most in the world is the feeling of wasting time
doing nothing. For this very reason, I can’t function without a task list
(let’s be honest, multiple task lists) and a tightly booked calendar.  
But I think this is a fragile equilibrium. It feels like walking on a tense
cotton yard. You know it will break, but in the meantime you feel comforted by
the sense of tranquillity only cotton could give you.

Am I living in autopilot?

Sometimes I wish I could be more spontaneous.  
Some weeks ago, I received a
message from [Francesco](https://nomnp.com) about some of the rules he
implemented in his life:

- Limit social media to 30 minutes per day;
- Dedicate at least 30 minutes per day to reading and take notes;
- Reduce caffeine intake.

While I’ve already implemented some of them, such as reducing caffeine
consumption and removing social media from my phone (I still check them on my
iPad or Mac, but I have a physical barrier between me and endless mindless
scrolling), not everything is perfect.

I realize that I need to simplify my life and embrace boredom. I believe that
boredom can stimulate creativity.

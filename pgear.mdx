### Cameras

<Product title="Canon EOS RP" image="/products/rp.jpeg" link="https://amzn.to/3laZSkY" description="The RP is the mirrorless I'm currently using. It's a perfectly capable stills camera. It's cheaper than other full frame cameras and still packs a punch. Autofocus is accurate. It uses the newest Canon mounting system but still supports every other EF lens I already own."/>

<Product title="Canon EOS 600D" image="/products/600d.jpg" link="https://amzn.to/3mQA3Hq" description="The surprising backup. It was my main camera, but now I only use it occasionally. Great little camera, a bit old but it can take useable pictures!"/>

### Lenses
<Product title="Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM" image="/products/50.jpeg" link="https://www.amazon.it/Canon-50mm-1-4-Obiettivo-diametro/dp/B00009XVCZ?&linkCode=sl1&tag=eliseomarte04-21&linkId=beab408cf8da05dfd5025b03b5107a00&language=it_IT&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" description="I don't have this model in particular but a 50mm is a great all around lens for your photography and you should try it at least once."/>

<Product title="Canon EF 85mm f/1.8 USM" image="/products/85.jpg" link="https://amzn.to/3ZFt6r4" description="My portrait workhorse. This lens is sooo sharp it can cut an apple!"/>

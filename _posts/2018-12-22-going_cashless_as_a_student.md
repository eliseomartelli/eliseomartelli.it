Before we start talking about _going cashless_ we need to talk about the reason behind this choice.  
Going _(almost)_ completely cashless ain't __easy__ and requires at least one rollback solution if something goes wrong (and yep, it __happens__).

As someone who loves tech but has a _love-hate_ relationship with money (especially with cash), going cashless means worrying less about the things you've got in your pocket.

Going cashless means relying on payment services and below you can find a list of the things I use daily to fulfill my payments needs.

## Services I Use

### Apps

#### Micropayments (Below €10)

[Satispay](http://satispay.it){:target="_blank"}. 
I use **Satispay** regularly for my _day-to-day_ payments of small (and _not-vital_) things. 
It's a _small and dependable_ app that's available on both iOS and Android. 
But a payment app has the priority of being adopted and here, in Turin, a lot of places accept Satispay.

This app is like the _Venmo of Italy_.

#### Normal Payments (€10 - €100)

**Normal payments** make up the most of my monthly expenses and the 99% of them go through my phone.  
The main app I use for this kind of payments is [Intesa San Paolo Mobile](https://www.intesasanpaolo.com/) (my bank).  
The app is **sleek** and **modern**, supports fingerprint and **NFC** payments.  
Since the widespread adoption of NFC point of sales is **continuously rising**, NFC mobile payments are a well-made possibility that's secure and practical.

#### Big Payments (100€+)
For bigger payments I use a mix of techniques.  
While using mostly credit/debit cards for my day to day payments, I've taken a different approach if the expense is recurring.
**Wire transfers**, as old as they are, can still be used for this kind of things.

### Worst cases (and how I fix them)

#### Public Transportation
Public transport tickets here in Turin can be a bit cumbersome for new-comers.  
You need to have a [BipCard](https://bip.piemonte.it/carta-bip-cose-e-come-funziona/) or some sorts of smartcard issued by your University (or workplace) then you can add bus tickets on that card.  
Paying for tickets can be done by going to a tobacconist (and using cash) or you can use the [GttToMove](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.to.gtt.tomove) and pay online (my preferred solution).

#### Farmer's Market
As someone who loves cooking and knows that the freshness of the ingredients is one of the most important things, Farmer's Markets are a **must**.  
The problem? Stands *aren't so happy to accept credit cards*, especially for small payments.
Cleanest solution? Rolling back to cash.  
It takes an extra step, but it's not that bad. I **plan my expenses** in advance to **minimize** the amount of spare cash left in the wallet so I'm almost cashless 😂.

### What's in my wallet?
One of the most asked questions to me is: "Hey, Eliseo, what's in your wallet?".
As someone that declares to be for the most part cashless, I've seen a _growing interest_ in my wallet from third parties.  
So here it is!

#### My wallet
- Credit card(s);
- University badge;
- A bottle opener;
- A paper cutter;
- A USB stick (yep, still a thing);
- Driving license;

It's *simple*, it's a part of my daily check **triple patting** (Wallet, phone and keys) and if I'm not going to drive, I can _leave it_ behind at home.

### Managing my expenses
You can argue that using cashless payment methods can alienate yourself from your own spending, and yeah, I'm with you on this one.  
You need to have a method to track what are you spending (and how) and after months of using a Google Drive Spreadsheet I've graduated to [Firefly III](https://firefly-iii.org/), a self-hosted money tracking solution.

Going cashless is **possible**, is convenient and less stressful (at least for me).
Thank you for your time and **#GoCashless**!
